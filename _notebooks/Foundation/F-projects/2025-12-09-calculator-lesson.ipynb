    "\n",
    "A calculator is a great way to learn the basics of a programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Students can start calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator project will introduce coder to basic user interface design and key event handling in JavaScript.  \n",
    "- Learn about STYLE and SCRIPT  \n",
    "- Learn how STYLE is integrated into THEME  \n",
    "\n",
    "* Many calculators are available on Internet and ChatGPT, search for \"calculator in javascript\".  Additionally, the Teachers has many generations of calculators...  \n",

    "## Code Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 HTML Structure\n",
    "The calculator is organized with `<div>` elements:\n",
    "- **`calculator-container`**: Holds all buttons and the display.\n",
    "- **`calculator-output`**: Shows the current number or result.\n",
    "- **Rows of buttons**: Each row contains numbers or operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `=`).\n",
    "- **Special buttons**: `A/C` clears the calculator, `=` performs the calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This structure makes the calculator easy to understand visually and connects each button to JavaScript logic.\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 JavaScript State\n",
    "The calculator uses variables to track what’s happening:\n",
    "- **`firstNumber`**: Stores the first number entered.\n",
    "- **`operator`**: Stores which operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) is chosen.\n",
    "- **`nextReady`**: A flag that tells the calculator whether to start fresh with a new number or keep appending digits.\n",
    "\n",
    "These variables act like the calculator’s memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 Event Listeners\n",
    "Event listeners connect user actions to code:\n",
    "- **Number buttons**: Call `number()` to update the display.\n",
    "- **Operation buttons**: Call `operation()` to store the operator and prepare for the next number.\n",
    "- **Equals button**: Runs `calculate()` to get the result.\n",
    "- **Clear button**: Resets everything back to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is how the calculator responds to clicks and user input.\n",
    "\n",
    "```JavaScript\n",
    "// Number buttons\n",
    "numbers.forEach(button => {\n",
    "  button.addEventListener(\"click\", () => {\n",
    "    number(button.textContent);\n",
    "  });\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 Calculation Logic\n",
    "The `calculate()` function decides what math to perform:\n",
    "- Uses a `switch` statement to check the operator.\n",
    "- `+` adds the numbers.\n",
    "- `-` subtracts the numbers.\n",
    "- `*` and `/` currently show **“TODO”** — students will implement these.\n",
    "\n",
    "This design makes it clear where new operations can be added.\n",
    "\n",
    "```JavaScript\n",
    "function calculate(first, second) {\n",
    "  switch (operator) {\n",
    "    case \"+\":\n",
    "      return first + second;\n",
    "    case \"-\":\n",
    "      return first - second;\n",
    "    case \"*\":\n",
    "```\n",

    "## Hacks\n",
    "\n",
    "Try these challenges to extend your calculator:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Hack 1: Implement Multiplication**\n",
    "   - Add logic for `*` in the `calculate()` function.  \n",
    "   - Hint: Use `first * second`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Hack 2: Implement Division**\n",
    "   - Add logic for `/` in the `calculate()` function.  \n",
    "   - Hint: Use `first / second`.  \n",
    "   - Bonus: Handle division by zero (show an error instead of crashing).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Hack 3: Add Keyboard Support**\n",
    "   - Listen for `keydown` events.  \n",
    "   - Map keys like `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `Enter`, and numbers to the calculator functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Hack 4: Style the Calculator**\n",
    "   - Change button colors, adjust spacing, or redesign the layout.  \n",
    "   - Try making the calculator theme match your site.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Hack 5: Add a New Operation**\n",
    "   - Extend the calculator with something new, like square root (`√`) or percentage (`%`).  \n",
    "   - Add a button in the HTML and logic in the `calculate()` function.\n",
