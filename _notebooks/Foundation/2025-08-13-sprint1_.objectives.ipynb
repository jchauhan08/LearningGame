    "\n",
    "Welcome to the **Open Coding Society** — where you'll master professional development tools while building your first team project.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Here's what makes this different:** Instead of just following instructions, you'll be actively documenting your setup process, troubleshooting problems, and creating solutions that help you and your teammates succeed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**You are a student developer** learning essential professional skills:\n",
    "- Master industry-standard development tools\n",
    "- Build team and individual GitHub Pages sites\n",
    "- Develop effective collaboration workflows\n",
    "- Document your learning journey\n",
    "\n",
    "This sprint mirrors real software engineering onboarding at technology companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Problem\n",
    "New students often feel overwhelmed in their first weeks: new tools, unfamiliar workflows, and unclear expectations. Your job is to master these essentials while helping your team succeed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Goal\n",
    "By the end of this sprint, you will:\n",
    "- **Build Sites**: Have your own team and individual GitHub Pages site online.\n",
    "- **Master Tools**: Be proficient with essential development tools.\n",
    "- **Document Progress**: Create clear documentation of your setup and learning process.\n",

    "\n",
    "> **Remember:** You are both a **learner** and a **documenter** in this sprint. Everything you experience as a new student — every success, every error, every breakthrough — becomes valuable documentation for yourself and others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dive into tools and code, let's tap into knowledge you already have. Even without programming experience, you've worked with concepts that will help you succeed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Familiar Learning Concepts\n",
    "You've likely used:\n",
    "- **Rubrics** – scoring guides that set clear expectations.  \n",
    "- **Checklists** – step-by-step task trackers to ensure nothing gets missed.  \n",
    "- **Assessments** – quizzes, reflections, or projects used to measure progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have also heard:\n",
    "- **Action verbs (Bloom's)** – words that describe different levels of thinking.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Remember** - Recall facts and basic concepts about tools and commands\n",
    "  - **Understand** - Explain how tools work and their purpose in development workflow  \n",
    "  - **Apply** - Perform basic setup, installation, and coding tasks\n",
    "  - **Analyze** - Troubleshoot problems by examining logs, error messages, and system behavior\n",
    "  - **Evaluate** - Assess and correct errors, compare solutions, and make correct tool choices; peer review others' work\n",
    "  - **Create** - Produce original code, customize configurations, and add to projects\n",
    "\n",
    "You are probably familiar with team words:\n",
    "- **The 4C's** – skills that make teams stronger and projects more effective.\n",
    "  - **Communication** - expressing what we are learning, both verbally and in writing.\n",
    "  - **Collaboration** - working together on tasks and coordinating team efforts.\n",
    "  - **Critical Thinking** - solving tough problems through cognition and systematic work.\n",
    "  - **Creativity** - making useful solutions out of many unknowns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your Learning Advantage\n",
    "\n",
    "You've spent over a decade experiencing different learning environments. Through **25+ teachers**, countless assignments, and various challenges, you've developed intuition about what helps you learn effectively—and what doesn't.\n",
    "\n",
    "**This experience helps you:**\n",
    "- **Recognize when you're confused** → Document what clarifies concepts for you\n",
    "- **Know how instructions should flow** → Create clear setup guides from your experience  \n",
    "- **Understand helpful feedback** → Give constructive peer reviews\n",
    "- **See when teams work well** → Contribute to effective collaboration\n",
    "- **Identify your learning style** → Track what keeps you engaged vs. when you're lost\n",
    "\n",
    "**As a student developer, you'll apply this by:**\n",
    "- **Documenting with clarity** → Drawing on frustrations to write better instructions\n",
    "- **Writing clear setup guides** → Using confusion points to create helpful documentation\n",
    "- **Building effective team workflows** → Designing collaboration that actually works\n",
    "- **Tracking your progress** → Showing your growth path through commits and reflections\n",
    "- **Testing and improving** → Refining based on what works\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Your Documentation Mission\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike experienced developers who must imagine the beginner experience, **you are the beginner**. Your authentic struggles with tools, concepts, and collaboration become **valuable documentation** for improving the onboarding process.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remember:** Every error you solve, every breakthrough you capture, and every clear instruction you write will directly help you review for assessments and help future students who follow your path.\n",
