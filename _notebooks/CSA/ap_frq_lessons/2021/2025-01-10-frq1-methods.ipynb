    "## FRQ Question Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This question involves the `WordMatch` class, which stores a secret string and provides methods that compare other strings to the secret string. You will write two methods in the `WordMatch` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `WordMatch` class has:\n",
    "- A private instance variable `secret` that stores the secret string\n",
    "- A constructor that initializes the secret string\n",
    "- Two methods to implement: `scoreGuess` and `findBetterGuess`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part A: scoreGuess()\n",
    "\n",
    "Write the `WordMatch` method `scoreGuess`. To determine the score to be returned, `scoreGuess` finds the number of times that `guess` occurs as a substring of `secret` and then multiplies that number by the square of the length of `guess`. Occurrences of `guess` may overlap within `secret`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume that the length of `guess` is less than or equal to the length of `secret` and that `guess` is not an empty string.\n",
