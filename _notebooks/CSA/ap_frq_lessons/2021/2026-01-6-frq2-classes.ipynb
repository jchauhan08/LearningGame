    "| 2 | Declares appropriate `private` instance variables including at least two `SingleTable` references | Responses can still earn the point even if they declare an additional instance variable to cache the number of seats at the combined table. Responses will **not** earn the point if they: declare and initialize local variables in the constructor instead of instance variables; declare additional instance variable(s) that cache the desirability rating; omit keyword `private`; declare variables outside the class | 1 point |\n",

    "| 9 | `getDesirability` computes average of constituent tables' view desirabilities | Responses can still earn the point even if they: call `getHeight` or `getViewQuality` on constructor parameters or local variables of type `SingleTable` in the constructor; fail to return the computed average (return is not assessed).

    "- **x)** Local variables used but none declared\n",
    "- **y)** Destruction of persistent data (e.g., changing value referenced by parameter)\n",
    "- **z)** Void method or constructor that returns a value\n",
    "\n",
    "#### No Penalty\n",
    "\n",
    "- Extraneous code with no side-effect (e.g., valid precondition check, no-op)\n",
    "- Spelling/case discrepancies where there is no ambiguity*\n",
    "- Local variable not declared provided other variables are declared in some part\n",
    "- `private` or `public` qualifier on a local variable\n",
    "- Missing `public` qualifier on class or constructor header\n",
    "- Keyword used as an identifier\n",
    "- Common mathematical symbols used for operators (`×` `•` `÷` `≤` `≥` `<>` `≠`)\n",
    "- `[]` vs. `()` vs. `<>`\n",
    "- `=` instead of `==` and vice versa\n",
    "- `length`/`size` confusion for array, `String`, `List`, or `ArrayList`; with or without `()`\n",
    "- Extraneous `[]` when referencing entire array\n",
    "- `[i,j]` instead of `[i][j]`\n",
    "- Extraneous size in array declaration, e.g., `int[size] nums = new int[size];`\n",
    "- Missing `;` where structure clearly conveys intent\n",
    "- Missing `{ }` where indentation clearly conveys intent\n",
    "- Missing `()` on parameter-less method or constructor invocations\n",
    "- Missing `()` around `if` or `while` conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "*Spelling and case discrepancies for identifiers fall under the \"No Penalty\" category only if the correction can be **unambiguously** inferred from context, for example, \"ArayList\" instead of \"ArrayList\". As a counterexample, note that if the code declares `\"int G=99, g=0;\"`, then uses `\"while (G < 10)\"` instead of `\"while (g < 10)\"`, the context does **not** allow for the reader to assume the use of the lower case variable."
