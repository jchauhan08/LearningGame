    "# Introduction to 2D Array Questions on AP CSA FRQs\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "2D Arrays are a common topic in the AP Computer Science A exam, appearing frequently in the Free-Response Question (FRQ) section. These questions test your ability to manipulate nested data structures and demonstrate core concepts of iteration, indexing, and logical problem-solving. \n",
    "\n",
    "2D Arrays represent grid-like data structures (like tables or matrices) and are widely used to solve problems related to game boards, seating charts, or pixel manipulation in images.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Demographics of 2D Array Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Frequency\n",
    "- Typically, **one FRQ per year** focuses heavily on 2D arrays or uses them as part of the solution.\n",
    "- Recent FRQs (from 2019–2023) include 2D array questions testing nested loops and problem-solving within a grid structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scoring Patterns\n",
    "- Students often secure **basic setup points** (e.g., correctly declaring/initializing a 2D array or accessing elements).\n",
    "- The most missed points are in **loop logic**, particularly handling **boundary conditions** (e.g., avoiding `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Student Errors\n",
    "1. Misusing row and column indices (`array[row][col]` vs. `array[col][row]`).\n",
    "2. Forgetting that a 2D array is an array of arrays, leading to confusion about its length (`array.length` for rows, `array[0].length` for columns).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## How 2D Array FRQs Are Typically Formatted\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part (a): Basic Access and Manipulation\n",
    "- **Common Tasks**:\n",
    "  - Traverse the array using nested loops.\n",
    "  - Return a value from a specific row/column or based on conditions (e.g., count all `true` values).\n",
    "- **Tips to Ensure Points**:\n",
    "  - Properly initialize variables.\n",
    "  - Use correct indexing: `array[i][j]`.\n",
    "  - Ensure loops iterate through the correct dimensions (`row` and `column` lengths).\n"
