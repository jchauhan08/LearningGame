    "These mistakes can cause point deductions on **any** FRQ and should always be avoided.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Duplicating instance variables that already exist in a superclass\n",
    "- Accessing private data directly instead of using methods\n",
    "- Using `==` instead of `.equals()` to compare Strings\n",

    "- Failing to follow method specifications exactly\n",

    "## 1 – Correct Use of Inheritance (`extends Book`)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**\n",
    "\n",
    "The FRQ requires `Textbook` to be a subclass of `Book`. This is correctly implemented using inheritance:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public class Textbook extends Book\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows Textbook to reuse the title, price, and methods such as `getTitle()` and `getBookInfo()` without redefining them. This ensures that title and price information remain in the Book class, as required by the prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2 – Proper Placement of Instance Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**\n",
    "\n",
    "The prompt states that a textbook has an edition number, which should be stored in the Textbook class:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "private int edition;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `edition` variable is not placed in Book because not all books have editions. This follows proper object-oriented design and avoids duplication of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3 – Constructor Uses `super` to Initialize Inherited Data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**\n",
    "\n",
    "The constructor must initialize title and price using the Book class and edition using the Textbook class:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public Textbook(String tbTitle, double tbPrice, int tbEdition) {\n",
    "    super(tbTitle, tbPrice);\n",
    "    edition = tbEdition;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Calling `super(tbTitle, tbPrice)` ensures that title and price are stored in the Book object. Direct access to title or price would be incorrect because they are private in Book.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4 – Accessor Method for Edition (`getEdition`)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**\n",
    "\n",
    "The sample execution calls `getEdition()`, so an accessor method must be provided:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public int getEdition() {\n",
    "    return edition;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This method returns the edition number and allows other classes to access it without violating encapsulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5 – Overriding `getBookInfo` Correctly\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**\n",
    "\n",
    "The FRQ specifies that `getBookInfo()` in Textbook should include the edition in the returned string:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public String getBookInfo() {\n",
    "    return super.getBookInfo() + \"-\" + edition;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `super.getBookInfo()` preserves the original formatting from Book and avoids rewriting code. Appending the edition produces the exact format shown in the sample output.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6 – Correct Logic in `canSubstituteFor`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**\n",
    "\n",
    "A textbook can substitute for another if:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The titles are the same\n",
    "- The edition of the current textbook is greater than or equal to the other\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public boolean canSubstituteFor(Textbook other) {\n",
    "    return other.getTitle().equals(getTitle()) && edition >= other.getEdition();\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `.equals()` method is used to compare Strings correctly, and the logical AND ensures both conditions must be true.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7 – Matching the Sample Execution Table\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation produces all expected results:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `getEdition()` returns the correct edition number\n",
    "- `getBookInfo()` returns a correctly formatted string\n",
    "- `canSubstituteFor()` returns true or false exactly as shown in the table\n",
    "\n",
    "This confirms the logic matches the problem specification.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8 – No Extraneous or Penalized Code\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Does not redefine title or price\n",
    "- Does not include unnecessary output statements\n",
    "- Does not modify persistent data unintentionally\n",
    "- Includes only required methods and instance variables\n",
