    "## Detailed Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part A: Constructor Logic\n",
    "The goal of the constructor is to initialize the `lights` 2D array.\n",
    "1.  **Instantiation**: First, we must create the array object itself using `lights = new boolean[numRows][numCols];`. Without this, `lights` is null and cannot hold data.\n",
    "2.  **Traversal**: We need to visit every single cell in this grid. A nested for-loop is the standard way to do this. The outer loop iterates through rows (`0` to `numRows - 1`), and the inner loop iterates through columns (`0` to `numCols - 1`).\n",
    "3.  **Probability**: For each cell, we generate a random number using `Math.random()`, which returns a `double` between `0.0` (inclusive) and `1.0` (exclusive). To get a 40% probability of being `true`, we check if the random number is less than `0.4`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part B: `evaluateLight` Logic\n",
    "This method decides the status of a specific light based on the column it resides in.\n",
    "1.  **Counting Lights**: Before checking rules, we need to know how many lights are \"on\" in the specified column (`col`). We iterate through every row `r` while keeping the column index fixed at `col`. If `lights[r][col]` is true, we increment a counter `numOn`.\n",
    "2.  **Applying Rules**:\n",
    "    *   **Rule 1 (Light is On)**: If `lights[row][col]` is true, we check if `numOn` is even (`numOn % 2 == 0`). If so, we return `false`.\n",
    "    *   **Rule 2 (Light is Off)**: If `lights[row][col]` is false (implicit `else` logic typically, but handled via specific checks here), we check if `numOn` is divisible by 3 (`numOn % 3 == 0`). If so, we return `true`.\n",
    "    *   **Rule 3 (Default)**: If neither of the specific conditions above triggers a change, we simply return the current state of the light: `lights[row][col]`."

    "## Common Mistakes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part A\n",
    "*   **Forgetting `new`**: A common error is declaring the array variable but forgetting to initialize it with `new boolean[rows][cols]`.\n",
    "*   **Row/Column Confusion**: Swapping `numRows` and `numCols` when creating the array or in the loops results in an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` if the grid isn't square.\n",
    "*   **Incorrect Probability**: Using `Math.random() * 0.4` or incorrect integer casting (e.g., `(int) Math.random()`) will not produce the correct distribution.\n",
    "*   **Re-rolling Probability**: Generating a random number once before the loops and applying it to every cell means all cells will be identical, rather than independently random.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part B\n",
    "*   **Iterating Wrong Dimension**: When counting lights in a **column**, the loop should vary the **row index** (`r` goes from `0` to `lights.length`), while the column index stays fixed. A common mistake is iterating over columns (`c`) instead.\n",
    "*   **Counting Logic**: Forgetting to initialize the counter to 0 inside the method.\n",
    "*   **Modulus Operator**: Using division `/` instead of modulus `%` to check for evenness or divisibility by 3.\n",
    "*   **Return Logic**: Attempting to combine all logic into a single complex boolean return statement often leads to errors. It is usually cleaner to use `if` statements for the specific exceptions (Rules 1 and 2) and a default return for Rule 3."
