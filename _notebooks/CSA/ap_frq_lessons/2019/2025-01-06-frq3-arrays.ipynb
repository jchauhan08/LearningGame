    "3. Many encoded strings contain *delimiters*. A delimiter is a non-empty string that acts as a boundary between different parts of a larger string. The delimiters involved in this question occur in pairs that must be *balanced*, with each pair having an open delimiter and a close delimiter. There will be only one type of delimiter for each string. The following are examples of delimiters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1\n",
    "Expressions in mathematics use open parentheses **\"(\"** and close parentheses **\")\"** as delimiters. For each open parenthesis, there must be a matching close parenthesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `(x + y) * 5` is a valid mathematical expression.\n",
    "* `(x + (y)` is **NOT** a valid mathematical expression because there are more open delimiters than close delimiters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 2\n",
    "HTML uses `<B>` and `</B>` as delimiters. For each open delimiter `<B>`, there must be a matching close delimiter `</B>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `<B> Make this text bold </B>` is valid HTML.\n",
    "* `<B> Make this text bold </UB>` is **NOT** valid HTML because there is one open delimiter and no matching close delimiter.\n",

    "In this question, you will write two methods in the following `Delimiters` class.\n",
