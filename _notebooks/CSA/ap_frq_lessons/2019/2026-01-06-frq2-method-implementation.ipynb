    "• addDailySteps, which accumulates information about steps, in readings taken once per day\n",
    "\n",
    "• activeDays, which returns the number of active days\n",
    "\n",
    "• averageSteps, which returns the average number of steps per day, calculated by dividing the total number of steps taken by the number of days tracked\n",
