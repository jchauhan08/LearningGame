    "This question involves reasoning about a number puzzle that is represented as a two-dimensional array of integers. Each element of the array initially contains a value between 1 and 9, inclusive. Solving the puzzle involves clearing pairs of array elements by setting them to 0. Two elements can be cleared if their values sum to 10 or if they have the same value. The puzzle is considered solved if all elements of the array are cleared. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will write the constructor and one method of the SumOrSameGame class, which contains the methods that manipulate elements of the puzzle. \n",
