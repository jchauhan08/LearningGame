    "## FRQ Question Description\n",
    "\n",
    "This question involves pairing competitors in a tournament into one-on-one matches for\n",
    "one round of the tournament. For example, in a chess tournament, the competitors are the\n",
    "individual chess players. A game of chess involving two players is a match. The winner of\n",
    "each match goes on to a match in the next round of the tournament. Since half of the players\n",
    "are eliminated in each round of the tournament, there is eventually a final round consisting\n",
    "of one match and two competitors. The winner of that match is considered the winner of the\n",
    "tournament.\n",
    "\n",
    "Competitors, matches, and rounds of the tournament are represented by the `Competitor`,\n",
    "`Match`, and `Round` classes. You will write the constructor and one method of the `Round` class.\n",
