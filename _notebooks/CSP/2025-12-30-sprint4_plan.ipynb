    "\n",
    "1. **Breaking out your own Full Stack Project**:\n",
    "   - Objective is to create something that belongs to you and could potentially lead to your CPT project.\n",
    "   - There will only be one person with rights to pull code into the repository.\n",
    "   - Groups will be 2-3 people, Teamas as close to 6 people as possible, but not over 6.\n",
    "   - Groups of 2-3 and indivuals of 1 will have very distinct features.\n",
    "   - **Persona Strengths are discussed**: [Planner](https://pages.opencodingsociety.com/persona/planner), [Scrummer](https://pages.opencodingsociety.com/persona/scrummer), [Technologist](https://pages.opencodingsociety.com/persona/technologist), [Closer](https://pages.opencodingsociety.com/persona/closer)\n",
    "     - **Leadership**: One Scrum Master, and one assistant/backup Scrum Master.\n",
    "     - **Integrations**: Two people with rights to pull code into the repository.\n",
    "     - **Deployment Admins**: Two people with rights to deploy.\n",
    "     - **Visual Design**: One person to maintain front-end design documentation.\n",
    "     - **Data Modeler**: One person to maintain backend API and database definition documentation.\n",
    "     - **Coders**: Everyone will have frontend and backend coding responsibilities for their personal end-to-end feature.\n",
    "     - **Multiple Roles/Hats**: You will likely have multiple jobs and coding responsibilities.\n",
    "   - Work will require coordination and design.  Teacher will be looking for standups, testing, discussion\n",
    "   - There will be weekly checkpoints, the will not necessarily be uniform or planned.\n",
    "   - The first checkpoints will show that you are meeting Big Idea requirements in planning, coordination, as well as meeting all the requirements for CPT.\n",
    "   - Read the CPT requirements and start a planning breakdown.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Extending ideas for your group Project**:\n",
    "   - Your project should have designs for signup, login, and your full stack features and actions.\n",
    "   - Each person in the team will have a clear path and design for full stack responsibility.\n",
    "   - Additional areas of consideration that must be considered:\n",
    "     - Jinja MVC [admin menu](https://flask.opencodingsociety.com/login)\n",
    "     - Javascript Frontend [home page](https://pages.opencodingsociety.com/plagiarism) a sample UI for a quest.\n",
    "     - Additional features mentioned below for a \".9\" or above\n",
    "   - Additional ideas may be found on [Pages](https://pages.opencodingsociety.com/navigation/courses/csp).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Teaching Elements**:\n",
    "   - There are teaching elements we will focus on in Big Ideas 1, 2, 4, and the remaining sections of Big Idea 3.\n",
    "   - Selection of these elements could impact a mandatory CompSci social media section to your Social Media project."
