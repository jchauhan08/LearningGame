## Why Learn API Development?

APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are the backbone of modern web and mobile apps. They let your frontend and backend communicate, enable integration with other services, and make your projects scalable and secure. By mastering API development with Flask, you’ll gain skills that are essential for real-world software engineering, teamwork, and building powerful, data-driven applications.
