  title: JavaScript Foundations & Student Teaching
  description: A key focus of this course is to make Web Games using JavaScript. Understanding fundamentals like control structures, data types, input/output, operators, classes, methods and parameters, basic inheritance, and documentation practices are essentiial. Students will be teaching lessons on these topics to their peers.  Each student will be responsible for a portion of the lesson, a popcorn hack, and homework.  Students will be graded on their teaching, the popcorn hack, and the homework they assign.  Students will also be graded on their participation in learning from their peers.

A challenge with some vision, questions, AI research, and more allow amazing things to be accomplished. Our goal is to participate in N@tM with the other CS classes and other classes from the Electives Department.  We should have a blog, progress in a game, and a series of lesson hacks to show off.
